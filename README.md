# 🏝️ Musashi's Island

> *"You must understand that there is more than one path to the top of the mountain."*  
> — **Miyamoto Musashi**

Welcome to **Musashi's Island**, our submission for the **IMC Prosperity Trading Challenge 2025**.

This project is named in honor of **Miyamoto Musashi** — the undefeated samurai, philosopher, and author of *The Book of Five Rings*. Like Musashi, we combine clarity of mind, adaptability, and discipline in the face of battle — or in our case, the fast-paced world of algorithmic trading.

> *"Perceive that which cannot be seen with the eye."*

Musashi lived by principles of constant improvement, strategy without hesitation, and seeing beyond the immediate. We carry that mindset into our code, our teamwork, and our approach to every market.
